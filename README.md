# GTPase-tension-bifurcation

This repo contains code for a bifurcation analysis of the GTPase-tension model in Zmurchok et al. 2018... see my webpage for links.

## Requirements

Matcont (we used version 7p2, availble at https://sourceforge.net/projects/matcont/files/matcont/matcont7p2/) and MATLAB. Python (we used version 3.8.7) for Fig 5 (see Fig5_reqs.txt for a list required packages). XPPAUT is available at http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html.

## Contents

- Fig1.m generates Fig 1A and 1B
- Fig2X.m generates Fig 2X, X = A,B,C
- Fig5.py generates Fig 5. You will need the packages listed in Fig5_reqs.txt to run this.
- bettercolors contains some better colors
- SingleGTPaseTension.m contains the functions
- GTPase-tension.ode for use with XPPAUT
- phaseplanes/
    - PPMaker6.m generates the panels for Fig 6
    - dXX/ are folders with .dat (.txt files) that contain information obtained from XPPAUT regarding the stable/unstable manifolds and the periodic solutions that exist in each region
- animation.m generates image files to be used in the Supplemental Video. The code is set to save these images to a folder '/imgs' which will have to be made before running the script. This requires Fig1.mat (generated by Fig1.m) and 2par-HSN-to-upper-NCH.mat (which we generated using the Matcont GUI).
